OS X Management
===============

A collection of little scripts used to manage Macs in our studios.


enrolme.sh
----------

Really simple bash script to fetch and install Profiles from our profile server, in the correct order.


powerman.pl
-----------

Power management script that ensures our Energy settings are maintained, but also dynamically shuts down systems depending upon how long they've been idle, whether there's still a user that seems to be present, and with variations for different studios.

The fairly insistent resetting of the Energy preferences is mainly a hangover from Mac OS X Tiger, when Energy settings seemed to be altered randomly. However, having this script running occasionally always keeps every system in perfect check, so I'm not changing my game plan.
